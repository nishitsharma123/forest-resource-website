                Forest Report 2019, 
                <br>here are some more details about the mangrove cover in India:
<br>
                State-wise Mangrove Cover:
            <br>  
            <br>  
                <span>West Bengal</span>: West Bengal, particularly the Sundarbans, has the largest mangrove cover in India.<br>

            <h2>Forest Carbon Stock</h2>
            <p>Forest carbon stock refers to the amount of carbon stored in the biomass and soil of forest ecosystems. Here are some general points and figures related to forest carbon stock:
<br><br>
                <span>Global Forest Carbon Stock</span>:
                
                According to the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the total forest carbon stock in the world was estimated to be around 861 gigatonnes of carbon.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span>Forest Carbon Stock by Region</span>:
            
                The distribution of forest carbon stock varies by region. Tropical forests, particularly those in the Amazon Basin, Congo Basin, and Southeast Asia, are known to store significant amounts of carbon.<br>
                Boreal and temperate forests, found in regions like North America, Europe, and Russia, also contribute to global carbon stocks.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span>Tropical Forests</span>:
                
                Tropical forests are estimated to store a substantial portion of the world's forest carbon. 
                <br><br>The Amazon rainforest alone is often referred to as the "lungs of the Earth" due to its crucial role in sequestering carbon dioxide.</p>

                Tribal populations are distributed across various states, with significant concentrations in central India, northeastern states, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and parts of southern India.<br><br>
                <span>Cultural Significance:</span>
                
                Tribal communities have distinct languages, traditions, and cultural practices that are deeply rooted in their relationship with nature and the forests.<br><br>
                <span>Dependency on Forests:</span>
                
                Historically, many tribal communities have been dependent on forests for their livelihoods, relying on hunting, gathering, and shifting cultivation for sustenance.
                Forests play a crucial role in the cultural identity and spiritual beliefs of many tribal groups.
                Forests in India:<br><br>
