        </div>

          <span class="question">What is sustainable forest management (SFM)?</span>
          <i class="bx bxs-chevron-down arrow"></i>
        </div>
        <p>Sustainable forest management is the responsible use and conservation of forests to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It aims to balance environmental, economic, and social objectives.</p>

          <span class="question"> What is deforestation, and why is it a concern?</span>
          <i class="bx bxs-chevron-down arrow"></i>
        </div>
        <p>Deforestation is the process of clearing or removing forests to make way for agriculture, infrastructure, or urban development. It is a concern because it leads to the loss of biodiversity, disrupts ecosystems, and contributes to climate change.</p>

          <i class="bx bxs-chevron-down arrow"></i>
        </div>
        <p>You can get involved by supporting conservation organizations, participating in reforestation and afforestation initiatives, advocating for sustainable forest management practices, and being mindful of your consumption of forest products.</p>

          <i class="bx bxs-chevron-down arrow"></i>
        </div>
        <p>You can promote responsible consumption by choosing products with certifications such as FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) or Rainforest Alliance, which indicate that the products are sourced sustainably. You can also reduce your consumption of paper and wood products.</p>
